<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a prospective **Master in Computational Science and Engineering** student at **Harvard University (Sep 2025 – May 2027, expected)**. I received my **B.Eng. in Electronic Information Engineering (AI Program)** from **Wuhan University** (GPA 3.86/4.0, Top 5%). My research and engineering work focus on building **efficient, fair, and reliable AI systems** across recommendation, event-based vision, and healthcare language interfaces.

My research interests include **Efficient Recommender Systems**, **Event-based Vision**, **Fair & Robust Multimodal Learning**, **Model Calibration**, **Spatiotemporal Representation Learning**, and **Responsible AI for Healthcare**.
